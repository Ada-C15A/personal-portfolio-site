                <!-- #1 -->
                <p style="font-size: 24px;">#1: Reading is not studying</p>
                <p>Simply reading and re-reading texts or notes is not actively engaging in the material. It is simply re-reading your notes. Only ‘doing’ the readings for class is not studying. It is simply doing the reading for class. Re-reading leads to quick forgetting.</p>

                <!-- #2 -->
                <p style="font-size: 24px;">#2: Spacing out is good</p>
                <p>One of the most impactful learning strategies is “distributed practice”—spacing out your studying over several short periods of time over several days and weeks (Newport, 2007). The most effective practice is to work a short time on each class every day. The total amount of time spent studying will be the same (or less) than one or two marathon library sessions, but you will learn the information more deeply and retain much more for the long term—which will help get you an A on the final. The important thing is how you use your study time, not how long you study. Long study sessions lead to a lack of concentration and thus a lack of learning and retention.

                <!-- #3 -->
                <p style="font-size: 24px;">#3: It’s good to be intense</p>
                <p>Not all studying is equal. You will accomplish more if you study intensively. Intensive study sessions are short and will allow you to get work done with minimal wasted effort. Shorter, intensive study times are more effective than drawn out studying.</p>

                <!-- #4 -->
                <p style="font-size: 24px;">#4: Silence isn’t golden
                </p>
                <p>Know where you study best. The silence of a library may not be the best place for you. It’s important to consider what noise environment works best for you. You might find that you concentrate better with some background noise. Some people find that listening to classical music while studying helps them concentrate, while others find this highly distracting. The point is that the silence of the library may be just as distracting (or more) than the noise of a gymnasium. Thus, if silence is distracting, but you prefer to study in the library, try the first or second floors where there is more background ‘buzz.’</p>

                <!-- #5 -->
                <p style="font-size: 24px;">#5: Problems are your friend
                </p>
                <p>Working and re-working problems is important for technical courses (e.g., math, economics). Be able to explain the steps of the problems and why they work.
                <br>
                In technical courses, it is usually more important to work problems than read the text (Newport, 2007). In class, write down in detail the practice problems demonstrated by the professor. Annotate each step and ask questions if you are confused. At the very least, record the question and the answer (even if you miss the steps).</p>
