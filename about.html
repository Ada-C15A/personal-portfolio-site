                        <p>I live in San Francisco and I graduated in San Francisco State University with a Bachelor degree in Hospitality and Tourism. </p>
                        <p>I am always curious about how developers make computer listen and react to users' requests.
                            Therefore, I went to City College to take two-year web development courses. I felt in love with programing and I wanted to learn more.
                            Later, I studied in programming bootcamp and I learned to build full-stack web and mobile apps. This build my programing foundation 
                            and it provided me a great opportunity to intern in a start-up company to build a financial user dashboard. Now, I have been contimued my programming journey
