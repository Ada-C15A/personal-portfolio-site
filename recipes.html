                                    <ul>
                                        <li> 1/2 cup Almond butter, creamy</li>
                                        <li> 1/3 tbsp Maple syrup, pure</li>
                                        <li>1/4 cup Cocoa powder</li>
                                        <li>2/3 cup Coconut flour</li>
                                        <li>1/4 tsp Kosher salt</li>
                                        <li>1/4 tsp Sea salt, flaky</li>
                                        <li>1 tsp Vanilla extract</li>
                                        <li>1 cup Coconut oil</li>
                                    </ul>
                            </div>

                    <h4> First we make the crust!</h4>
                        <p>We make the crust with coconut flour, maple syrup, and coconut oil.
                        We use coconut flour specifically to make a cookie base with a texture that’s more similar to shortbread than any other gluten-free flour I’ve tried.</p>
                    <h4>How do you make a No-Cook Caramel Filling?</h4>
                        <p>This is my favorite thing and it’s SO easy. It can be made in the microwave or on the stove, but you’re really not
                        cooking, just melting the following ingredients together:
                        Almond Butter, Maple Syrup, Coconut Oil, Vanilla Extract, Salt<br>
                        Once the ingredients are fully combined, you’ll pour the scrumptious mixture over the cooled crust.<br>
                        The almond butter tastes so nutty and delicious here, but cashew butter also makes a fabulous substitute – it gives an even more caramelly
                        flavor!
                        Peanut butter also works and tastes delicious, but has a stronger flavor.</p>
                        <h4>Now let’s make the easiest homemade chocolate.</h4>
                        <p>Coconut Oil, Cocoa Powder, Maple Syrup
                        Yup, you only need three ingredients! You just melt these together, whisk until smooth, and then pour the chocolate over
                        the caramel and let it set.<br>
                        
                        However, if you don’t want to bother with making your own, you can also just melt some dark chocolate and spread it over
                        the top!<br>
                        
                        I opted to sprinkle a bit of fleur de sel over the top before the chocolate set, too. I’m a believer that a sprinkle of
                        flaky sea salt makes pretty much anything better and I loved the bite of crunchy salt on these homemade healthy Twix
                        bars. It’s the perfect complement to the sweet filling, but you can leave it off for a more classic flavor.</p>

                        <h4> BAKED APPLE PIE RICE PAPER ROLLS</h4>
                            <p>These Baked Apple Pie Rice Paper Rolls can be a little bit tricky to master. The trick is to not get the rice paper too wet 
                            and to place the finished rolls onto a well oiled pan. You’ll need to turn them several times throughout baking. 
                            Some people found that doubling up the rice paper helped, especially if you want to deep fry them instead.</p>

                            <p>Preheat your oven to 400F. Peel, then slice the apples. Mix with the apple slices with the brown sugar and cinnamon.
                            Fill a large mixing bowl 1/4 full with water. Place the rice paper into the water one sheet at a time. Soak just until it’s soft enough to work with.<br>
                            Place the softened rice paper onto the counter and place 1- 2 Tbsp of apple mixture onto the center. Fold the bottom up first, then fold the sides in, 
                            fold the top down last. Repeat, until you have used up all of the apples.
                            Place onto a pan brushed with oil. Brush both sides with oil.  Bake for 20 – 25 minutes turning a few times throughout.</p>
