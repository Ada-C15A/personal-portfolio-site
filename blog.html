            <p>Anything that, in happening, causes something else to happen, causes something else to happen. The cheapest way to
                escape despair is to take refuge in one’s imagination. This is room service, I’m in a room and I want some service.
                A common mistake that people make when trying to design something completely foolproof was to underestimate the
                ingenuity of complete fools. “In five years I will have razed this planet, eaten its young, and stacked your skulls
                high in my honor.”</p><p>Where do you stand on the whole Babel fish argument? Odin could be enjoying a nice horn of honey meade and your call
                might make him drop it, then holy Zark it’s Ragnarok. Dreams come true all the time, just not for the dreamers. If
                beauty is in the eye of the beholder, then the beholder won’t be a Vogon, because even Vogons know how ugly they
                are. The Sandwich Maker almost sliced his thumb off.</p>

            <p>We need some serious room service. Nothing travels faster than the speed of light with the possible exception of
                bad news, which obeys its own special laws. You ask this of me who have contemplated the very vectors of the atoms
                in the Big Bang itself? Molest me not with this pocket calculator stuff.In other words—and this is the rock-solid
                principle on which the whole of the Corporation’s Galaxywide success is founded—their fundamental design flaws are
                completely hidden by their superficial design flaws. At times of major crisis he found it was often quite helpful
                to have his life flash before his eyes.</p>
