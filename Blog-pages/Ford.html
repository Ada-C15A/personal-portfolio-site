    <h2><q> Ford,</q> he said, <q> you’re turning into a penguin. Stop it.</q> </h2>

    <p>Anything that, in happening, causes something else to happen, causes something else to happen. The cheapest way to
        escape despair is to take refuge in one’s imagination. This is room service, I’m in a room and I want some service.
        A common mistake that people make when trying to design something completely foolproof was to underestimate the
        ingenuity of complete fools. “In five years I will have razed this planet, eaten its young, and stacked your skulls
        high in my honor.”</p>
    <p>Where do you stand on the whole Babel fish argument? Odin could be enjoying a nice horn of honey meade and your call
        might make him drop it, then holy Zark it’s Ragnarok. Dreams come true all the time, just not for the dreamers. If
        beauty is in the eye of the beholder, then the beholder won’t be a Vogon, because even Vogons know how ugly they
        are. The Sandwich Maker almost sliced his thumb off.</p>
        <p>He came to a few minutes later and pretended not to know who he was, where he was or how he had got there, but was
            not able to convince anybody. Where do you stand on the whole Babel fish argument? The cow was cowed. Today was one
            of those bad days. You live and learn. At any rate, you live.</p>
            <p>Let’s be straight here. If we find something we can’t understand we like to call it something you can’t understand,
                or indeed pronounce. He wouldn’t try to beat the system, he would just use it. “Think of a number, any number.” “Er,
                five,” said the mattress. “Wrong,” said Marvin. “You see?” Life was so pleasant and relaxed these days, there was
                time to let things sink in. Honestly, Arthur, you humans only use ten percent of your brains, and you fill that
                fraction with tea-related information.</p>
